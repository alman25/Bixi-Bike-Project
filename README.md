# Bixi Bike Project

https://www.bixi.com/en/open-data

This is a 2 part project I completed using SQL and Tableau. I researched data about Bixi Bikes, which is a self service bike sharing system commonly used in Montreal QC, Canada. These are similar to Citibikes in NYC. 

I provided my SQL codes. Part 1 shows the insights I gathered from my research and Part 2 shows screen shots of the Tableau graphs I created drawing additional insights.

The data I gathered was from the link provided above.
